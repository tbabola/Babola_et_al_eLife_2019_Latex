abstract = {Spontaneous electrical activity generated by developing sensory cells and neurons is crucial for the maturation of neural circuits. The full maturation of mammalian auditory inner hair cells (IHCs) depends on patterns of spontaneous action potentials during a 'critical period' of development. The intrinsic spiking activity of IHCs can be modulated by inhibitory input from cholinergic efferent fibres descending from the brainstem, which transiently innervate immature IHCs. However, it remains unknown whether this transient efferent input to developing IHCs is required for their functional maturation. We used a mouse model that lacks the a9-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit (a9nAChR) in IHCs and another lacking synaptotagmin-2 in the efferent terminals to remove or reduce efferent input to IHCs, respectively. We found that the efferent system is required for the developmental linearization of the Ca2p-sensitivity of vesicle fusion at IHC ribbon synapses, without affecting their general cell development. This provides the first direct evidence that the efferent system, by modulating IHC electrical activity, is required for the maturation of the IHC synaptic machinery. The central control of sensory cell development is unique among sensory systems. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

abstract = {Before the onset of hearing, which occurs around postnatal day 12 (P12) in mice, inner hair cells (IHCs) of the immature cochlea generate sound-independent Ca2+ action potentials (APs), which stimulate the auditory pathway and guide maturation of neuronal circuits. During these early postnatal days, intercellular propagating Ca2+ waves elicited by ATP-induced ATP release are found in inner supporting cells (ISCs). It is debated whether IHCs are able to fire Ca2+ APs independently or require a trigger by an ISC Ca2+ wave. To identify the Ca2+ transients of IHCs underlying Ca2+ APs and to analyze their dependence on ISC Ca2+ waves, we performed fast Ca2+ imaging of Fluo-8 AM-loaded organs of Corti at P4/P5. Fast Ca2+ transients (fCaTs) generated by IHCs were simultaneously imaged with Ca2+ waves in ISCs. ISC Ca2+ waves frequently evoked bursts consisting of {\textgreater}5 fCaTs in multiple adjacent IHCs. Although Ca2+ elevations of small amplitude appeared to be triggered by ISC Ca2+ waves in IHCs of Cav1.3 knockout mice we never observed fCaTs, indicating their requirement for Ca2+ influx through Cav1.3 channels. The Ca2+ wave-triggered Ca2+ upstroke in wildtype IHCs occurred 0.52 ± 0.27 s later than the rise of the Ca2+ signal in the adjacent ISCs. In comparison, superfusion of 1 $\mu$M ATP elicited bursts of fCaTs in IHCs starting 0.99 ± 0.34 s prior to Ca2+ elevations in adjacent ISCs. PPADS irreversibly abolished Ca2+ waves in ISCs and reversibly reduced fCaTs in IHCs indicating differential involvement of P2 receptors. IHC and ISC Ca2+ signals were however unaltered in P2X2R/P2X3R double knockout or in P2X7R knockout mice. Together, our data revealed a fairly similar occurrence of fCaTs within a burst (56.5{\%}) compared with 43.5{\%} as isolated single fCaTs or in groups of 2–5 fCaTs (minibursts). We provide evidence that IHCs autonomously generate single fCaTs and minibursts whereas bursts synchronized between neighboring IHCs were mostly triggered by ISC Ca2+ waves. Neonatal IHCs thus spontaneously generate electrical and Ca2+ activity, which is enhanced and largely synchronized by activity of ISCs of K{\"{o}}lliker's organ indicating two sources of spontaneous activity in the developing auditory system.},

abstract = {Before the onset of sensory transduction, developing neural circuits spontaneously generate correlated activity in distinct spatial and temporal patterns. During this period of patterned activity, sensory maps develop and initial coarse connections are refined, which are critical steps in the establishment of adult neural circuits. Over the last decade, there has been substantial evidence that altering the pattern of spontaneous activity disrupts refinement, but the mechanistic understanding of this process remains incomplete. In this review, we discuss recent experimental and theoretical progress toward the process of activity-dependent refinement, focusing on circuits in the visual, auditory, and motor systems. Although many outstanding questions remain, the combination of several novel approaches has brought us closer to a comprehensive understanding of how complex neural circuits are established by patterned spontaneous activity during development.},

Both features are due to the activity of astrocytic potassium channels. Astrocytes express a variety of voltage-dependent and leak potassium channels on the plasma membrane that contribute to the hyperpolarized resting membrane potential and other cellular processes. This chapter focuses on measuring K(+) channel function in astrocytes, focusing on Kir4.1, an inwardly rectifying potassium channel. We and others have demonstrated that Kir4.1 contributes significantly to the high-resting K(+) conductance and the hyperpolarized resting membrane potential.

abstract = {Astrocytes are electrically nonexcitable cells that display increases in cytosolic calcium ion (Ca²+) in response to various neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. However, the physiological role of astrocytic Ca²+ signaling remains controversial. We show here that astrocytic Ca²+ signaling ex vivo and in vivo stimulated the Na+,K+-ATPase (Na+- and K+-dependent adenosine triphosphatase), leading to a transient decrease in the extracellular potassium ion (K+) concentration. This in turn led to neuronal hyperpolarization and suppressed baseline excitatory synaptic activity, detected as a reduced frequency of excitatory postsynaptic currents. Synaptic failures decreased in parallel, leading to an increase in synaptic fidelity. The net result was that astrocytes, through active uptake of K+, improved the signal-to-noise ratio of synaptic transmission. Active control of the extracellular K+ concentration thus provides astrocytes with a simple yet powerful mechanism to rapidly modulate network activity.},

The faulty assembly or disintegration of such circuits results in disorders of the nervous system. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms that guide axons and lead to neural circuit formation is of interest not only to developmental neuroscientists but also for a better comprehension of neural disorders. Recent studies have demonstrated how crosstalk between different families of guidance receptors can regulate axonal navigation at choice points, and how changes in growth cone behaviour at intermediate targets require changes in the surface expression of receptors. These changes can be achieved by a variety of mechanisms, including transcription, translation, protein-protein interactions, and the specific trafficking of proteins and mRNAs. Here, I review these axon guidance mechanisms, highlighting the most recent advances in the field that challenge the textbook model of axon guidance.},

abstract = {Normal development, function and repair of the sensory epithelia in the inner ear are all dependent on gap junctional intercellular communication. Mutations in the connexin genes GJB2 and GJB6 (encoding CX26 and CX30) result in syndromic and non-syndromic deafness via various mechanisms. Clinical vestibular defects, however, are harder to connect with connexin dysfunction. Cx26 and Cx30 proteins are widely expressed in the epithelial and connective tissues of the cochlea, where they may form homomeric or heteromeric gap junction channels in a cell-specific and spatiotemporally complex fashion. Despite the study of mutant channels and animal models for both recessive and dominant autosomal deafness, it is still unclear why gap junctions are essential for auditory function, and why Cx26 and Cx30 do not compensate for each other in vivo. Cx26 appears to be essential for normal development of the auditory sensory epithelium, but may be dispensable during normal hearing. Cx30 appears to be essential for normal repair following sensory cell loss. The specific modes of intercellular signalling mediated by inner ear gap junction channels remain undetermined, but they are hypothesised to play essential roles in the maintenance of ionic and metabolic homeostasis in the inner ear. Recent studies have highlighted involvement of gap junctions in the transfer of essential second messengers between the non-sensory cells, and have proposed roles for hemichannels in normal hearing. Here, we summarise the current knowledge about the molecular and functional properties of inner ear gap junctions, and about tissue pathologies associated with connexin mutations.},

@article{Sretavan1986,
abstract = {During prenatal development of the cat's retinogeniculate projection, inputs from the ganglion cell axons of the two eyes are initially intermixed with each other within the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). As development proceeds, the inputs sort out to give rise to the eye-specific layers characteristic of the adult. During this sorting out process, individual axons undergo a stereotyped sequence of morphological changes that ultimately produce the characteristic pattern of arborization in which axon arbors are restricted in extent only to those layers of the LGN appropriate for the eye of origin (Sretavan and Shatz, 1984, 1986). Here, we examine whether binocular interactions between retinal ganglion cell axons from the two eyes are required for the formation of this restricted pattern of terminal arborization. To examine this question, one eye was removed at embryonic day 23 (E23), when ganglion cell axons have not yet reached the optic chiasm, and the ganglion cell axons from the remaining eye were allowed to develop in the complete absence of binocular interactions. At E59, when segregation into eye-specific layers is normally almost complete, the retinogeniculate projection from the remaining eye was then examined both by anterograde transport following intraocular injections of 3H-leucine and by the in vitro filling of individual ganglion cell axons with HRP. Results from the intraocular injections showed that in the absence of one eye, the remaining eye is still capable of forming both ipsilateral and contralateral optic tracts; however, the projection was distributed diffusely throughout each LGN, rather than being confined to normal eye-specific territories. When individual HRP-filled axons were reconstructed and examined, it was remarkable to find that the pattern of terminal arborization was virtually indistinguishable from normal axons. As usual, arbors were restricted to the distal portion of each axon trunk, and measurements showed that the total linear length of axon contributing to each arbor was within the normal range (enucleated, 2310 +/- 920 microns; normal, 2520 +/- 810 microns). Furthermore, the terminal arborizations of axons appeared to be organized into a series of tiers within the LGN in a pattern surprisingly similar to the pattern of eye-specific layers normally present by E59. Also unchanged was the normally occurring loss of axons from the remaining optic nerve: Counts at E59 showed that about 2.3 X 10(5) axons were present in enucleated animals as compared to 2.5 X 10(5) axons in controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Inc. Type I spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) transmit sound information from cochlear hair cells to the CNS. Using transcriptome analysis of thousands of single neurons, we demonstrate that murine type I SGNs consist of subclasses that are defined by the expression of subsets of transcription factors, cell adhesion molecules, ion channels, and neurotransmitter receptors. Subtype specification is initiated prior to the onset of hearing during the time period when auditory circuits mature. Gene mutations linked to deafness that disrupt hair cell mechanotransduction or glutamatergic signaling perturb the firing behavior of SGNs prior to hearing onset and disrupt SGN subtype specification. We thus conclude that an intact hair cell mechanotransduction machinery is critical during the pre-hearing period to regulate the firing behavior of SGNs and their segregation into subtypes. Because deafness is frequently caused by defects in hair cells, our findings have significant ramifications for the etiology of hearing loss and its treatment. Single-cell analyses of mouse type I spiral ganglion neurons characterize three functionally distinct subtypes, revealing insights into auditory processing with implications for treating congenital deafness.},

In the developing auditory system, inner hair cells (IHCs) spontaneously fire Ca2+ spikes, each of which is transformed into a mini-burst of action potentials in spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). Here we show that NMDARs are expressed in SGN dendritic terminals and play a critical role during transmission of activity from IHCs to SGNs before hearing onset. NMDAR activation enhances glutamate-mediated Ca2+ influx at dendritic terminals, promotes repetitive firing of individual SGNs in response to each synaptic event, and enhances coincident activity of neighboring SGNs that will eventually encode similar frequencies of sound. Loss of NMDAR signaling from SGNs reduced their survival both in vivo and in vitro, revealing that spontaneous activity in the prehearing cochlea promotes maturation of auditory circuitry through periodic activation of NMDARs in SGNs. Zhang-Hooks et al. find that NMDARs play a crucial role in development of the cochlea. By prolonging synaptic excitation at IHC-SGN synapses, NMDARs enhance repetitive firing of SGNs, increase dendritic Ca2+ influx, and promote SGN integration into the auditory pathway.},

abstract = {Neurons in the developing auditory system fire bursts of action potentials before the onset of hearing. This spontaneous activity promotes the survival and maturation of auditory neurons and the refinement of synaptic connections in auditory nuclei; however, the mechanisms responsible for initiating this activity remain uncertain. Previous studies indicate that inner supporting cells (ISCs) in the developing cochlea periodically release ATP, which depolarizes inner hair cells (IHCs), leading to bursts of action potentials in postsynaptic spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). To determine when purinergic signaling appears in the developing cochlea and whether it is responsible for initiating auditory neuron activity throughout the prehearing period, we examined spontaneous activity from ISCs, IHCs, and SGNs in cochleae acutely isolated from rats during the first three postnatal weeks. We found that ATP was released from ISCs within the cochlea from birth until the onset of hearing, which led to periodic inward currents, Ca(2+) transients, and morphological changes in these supporting cells. This spontaneous release of ATP also depolarized IHCs and triggered bursts of action potentials in SGNs for most of the postnatal prehearing period, beginning a few days after birth as IHCs became responsive to ATP, until the onset of hearing when ATP was no longer released from ISCs. When IHCs were not subject to purinergic excitation, SGNs exhibited little or no activity. These results suggest that supporting cells in the cochlea provide the primary excitatory stimulus responsible for initiating bursts of action potentials in auditory nerve fibers before the onset of hearing.},

abstract = {Gap junction-mediated K(+) recycling in the cochlear supporting cell has been proposed to play a critical role in hearing. However, how potassium ions enter into the supporting cells to recycle K(+) remains undetermined. In this paper, we report that ATP can mediate K(+) sinking to recycle K(+) in the cochlear supporting cells. We found that micromolar or submicromolar levels of ATP could evoke a K(+)-dependent inward current in the cochlear supporting cells. At negative membrane potentials and the resting membrane potential of -80 mV, the amplitude of the ATP-evoked inward current demonstrated a linear relationship to the extracellular concentration of K(+), increasing as the extracellular concentration of K(+) increased. The inward current also increased as the concentration of ATP was increased. In the absence of ATP, there was no evoked inward current for extracellular K(+) challenge in the cochlear supporting cells. The ATP-evoked inward current could be inhibited by ionotropic purinergic (P2X) receptor antagonists. Application of pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonic acid (PPADS, 50 microM) or pre-incubation with an irreversible P2X7 antagonist oxidized ATP (oATP, 0.1 mM) completely abolished the ATP-evoked inward current at the negative membrane potential. ATP also evoked an inward current at cell depolarization, which could be inhibited by intracellular Cs(+) and eliminated by positive holding potentials. Our data indicate that ATP can activate P2X receptors to recycle K(+) in the cochlear supporting cells at the resting membrane potential under normal physiological and pathological conditions. This ATP-mediated K(+) recycling may play an important role in the maintenance of cochlear ionic homeostasis.

abstract = {In the auditory system, type I spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) convey complex acoustic information from inner hair cells (IHCs) to the brainstem. Although SGNs exhibit variation in physiological and anatomical properties, it is unclear which features are endogenous and which reflect input from synaptic partners. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we derived a molecular classification of mouse type I SGNs comprising three subtypes that express unique combinations of Ca2+binding proteins, ion channel regulators, guidance molecules, and transcription factors. Based on connectivity and susceptibility to age-related loss, these subtypes correspond to those defined physiologically. Additional intrinsic differences among subtypes and across the tonotopic axis highlight an unexpectedly active role for SGNs in auditory processing. SGN identities emerge postnatally and are disrupted in a mouse model of deafness that lacks IHC-driven activity. These results elucidate the range, nature, and origins of SGN diversity, with implications for treatment of congenital deafness. Single cell analyses of mouse type I spiral ganglion neurons characterize three functionally distinct subtypes, revealing insights into auditory processing with implications for treating congenital deafness.},

abstract = {Age-related hearing loss and noise-induced hearing loss are major causes of human morbidity. Here we used genetics and functional studies to show that a shared cause of these disorders may be loss of function of the ATP-gated P2X(2) receptor (ligand-gated ion channel, purinergic receptor 2) that is expressed in sensory and supporting cells of the cochlea. Genomic analysis of dominantly inherited, progressive sensorineural hearing loss DFNA41 in a six-generation kindred revealed a rare heterozygous allele, P2RX2 c.178G {\textgreater} T (p.V60L), at chr12:133,196,029, which cosegregated with fully penetrant hearing loss in the index family, and also appeared in a second family with the same phenotype. The mutation was absent from more than 7,000 controls. P2RX2 p.V60L abolishes two hallmark features of P2X(2) receptors: ATP-evoked inward current response and ATP-stimulated macropore permeability, measured as loss of ATP-activated FM1-43 fluorescence labeling. Coexpression of mutant and WT P2X(2) receptor subunits significantly reduced ATP-activated membrane permeability. P2RX2-null mice developed severe progressive hearing loss, and their early exposure to continuous moderate noise led to high-frequency hearing loss as young adults. Similarly, among family members heterozygous for P2RX2 p.V60L, noise exposure exacerbated high-frequency hearing loss in young adulthood. Our results suggest that P2X(2) function is required for life-long normal hearing and for protection from exposure to noise.},

abstract = {Platelet activation is characterized by shape change, induction of fibrinogen receptor expression and release of granular contents, leading to aggregation and plug formation. While this response is essential for hemostasis, it is also important in the pathogenesis of a broad spectrum of diseases, including myocardial infarction, stroke and unstable angina. Adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) induces platelet aggregation, but the mechanism for this has not been established, and the relative contribution of ADP in hemostasis and the development of arterial thrombosis is poorly understood. We show here that the purinoceptor P2Y1 is required for platelet shape change in response to ADP and is also a principal receptor mediating ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Activation of P2Y1 resulted in increased intracellular calcium but no alteration in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. P2Y1-deficient platelets partially aggregated at higher ADP concentrations, and the lack of P2Y1 did not alter the ability of ADP to inhibit cAMP, indicating that platelets express at least one additional ADP receptor. In vivo, the lack of P2Y1 expression increased bleeding time and protected from collagen- and ADP-induced thromboembolism. These findings support the hypothesis that the ATP receptor P2Y1 is a principal receptor mediating both physiologic and pathological ADP-induced processes in platelets.},

In the auditory system, rhythmic bursts of spontaneous activity are generated in cochlear hair cells and propagated along central auditory pathways. The role of these activity patterns in the development of central auditory circuits has remained speculative. Here we demonstrate that blocking efferent cholinergic neurotransmission to developing hair cells in mice that lack the $\alpha$9 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ($\alpha$9 KO mice) altered the temporal fine structure of spontaneous activity without changing activity levels. KO mice showed a severe impairment in the functional and structural sharpening of an inhibitory tonotopic map, as evidenced by deficits in synaptic strengthening and silencing of connections and an absence in axonal pruning. These results provide evidence that the precise temporal pattern of spontaneous activity before hearing onset is crucial for the establishment of precise tonotopy, the major organizing principle of central auditory pathways.},

abstract = {Key points Intercellular Ca2+ waves are increases in cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels that propagate between cells. Periodic Ca2+ waves have been linked to gene regulation and are thought to play a crucial role in the development of our hearing epithelium, the organ of Corti and the acquisition of hearing. We observed regular periodic intercellular Ca2+ waves in supporting cells of an ex vivo preparation of the adult mouse organ of Corti, and these waves were found to propagate independently of extracellular ATP and were inhibited by the gap junction blockers 1-octanol and carbenoxolone. Our results establish that the existence of periodic Ca2+ waves in the organ of Corti is not restricted to the prehearing period. Abstract We have investigated wave-like cytoplasmic calcium (Ca2+) signalling in an ex vivo preparation of the adult mouse organ of Corti. Two types of intercellular Ca2+ waves that differ in propagation distance and speed were observed. One type was observed to travel up to 100 ?m with an average velocity of 7 ?m/s. Such waves were initiated by local tissue damage in the outer hair cell region. The propagation distance was decreased when the purinergic receptor antagonists pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2?,4?-disulfonic acid (PPADS; 50 ?m) or suramin (150 ?m) were added to the extracellular buffer. Immunocytochemical analysis and experiments with calcium indicator dyes showed that both P2X and P2Y receptors were present in supporting cells. A second class of waves identified to travel longitudinally along the organ of Corti propagated at a lower velocity of 1?3 ?m/s. These ?slow? Ca2+ waves were particularly evident in the inner sulcus and Deiters? cells. They travelled for distances of up to 500 ?m. The slow Ca2+ signalling varied periodically (approximately one wave every 10 min) and was maintained for more than 3 h. The slow waves were not affected by apyrase, or by the P2 receptor agonists suramin (150 ?m) or PPADS (50 ?m) but were blocked by the connexin channel blockers octanol (1 mm) and carbenoxolone (100 ?m). It is proposed that the observed Ca2+ waves might be a physiological response to a change in extracellular environment and may be involved in critical gene regulation activities in the supporting cells of the cochlea.},

We asked whether these cortical structures require sensory input to develop or are driven by intrinsic activity. Thalamocortical columns, connecting the thalamus to the cortex, emerge before sensory input and concur with calcium waves in the embryonic thalamus. We show that the columnar organization of the thalamocortical somatotopic map exists in the mouse embryo before sensory input, thus linking spontaneous embryonic thalamic activity to somatosensory map formation. Without thalamic calcium waves, cortical circuits become hyperexcitable, columnar and barrel organization does not emerge, and the somatosensory map lacks anatomical and functional structure. Thus, a self-organized protomap in the embryonic thalamus drives the functional assembly of murine thalamocortical sensory circuits.},

Here, the expression of the P2X7 receptor subunit was studied in the embryonic (E14–E18 days) and postnatal (P0–adult) rat cochlea using immunohistochemistry. Strong P2X7 immunolabelling was observed in the primary auditory neurons of the spiral ganglion from E18 to adult and in the fibres innervating the sensory inner and outer hair cells from birth to adult. Strong immunolabelling of P2X7 receptor protein was also observed in the inner and outer hair cells over a limited developmental period, from birth to P6.

abstract = {The morphological and functional development of the vertebrate nervous system is initially governed by genetic factors and subsequently refined by neuronal activity. However, fundamental features of the nervous system emerge before sensory experience is possible. Thus, activity-dependent development occurring before the onset of experience must be driven by spontaneous activity, but the origin and nature of activity in vivo remains largely untested. Here we use optical methods to show in live neonatal mice that waves of spontaneous retinal activity are present and propagate throughout the entire visual system before eye opening. This patterned activity encompassed the visual field, relied on cholinergic neurotransmission, preferentially initiated in the binocular retina and exhibited spatiotemporal correlations between the two hemispheres. Retinal waves were the primary source of activity in the midbrain and primary visual cortex, but only modulated ongoing activity in secondary visual areas. Thus, spontaneous retinal activity is transmitted through the entire visual system and carries patterned information capable of guiding the activity-dependent development of complex intra- and inter-hemispheric circuits before the onset of vision.},

abstract = {The sense of hearing is remarkable for its auditory dynamic range, which spans more than 10(12) in acoustic intensity. The mechanisms that enable the cochlea to transduce high sound levels without damage are of key interest, particularly with regard to the broad impact of industrial, military, and recreational auditory overstimulation on hearing disability. We show that ATP-gated ion channels assembled from P2X2 receptor subunits in the cochlea are necessary for the development of temporary threshold shift (TTS), evident in auditory brainstem response recordings as sound levels rise. In mice null for the P2RX2 gene (encoding the P2X2 receptor subunit), sustained 85-dB noise failed to elicit the TTS that wild-type (WT) mice developed. ATP released from the tissues of the cochlear partition with elevation of sound levels likely activates the broadly distributed P2X2 receptors on epithelial cells lining the endolymphatic compartment. This purinergic signaling is supported by significantly greater noise-induced suppression of distortion product otoacoustic emissions derived from outer hair cell transduction and decreased suprathreshold auditory brainstem response input/output gain in WT mice compared with P2RX2-null mice. At higher sound levels (≥95 dB), additional processes dominated TTS, and P2RX2-null mice were more vulnerable than WT mice to permanent hearing loss due to hair cell synapse disruption. P2RX2-null mice lacked ATP-gated conductance across the cochlear partition, including loss of ATP-gated inward current in hair cells. These data indicate that a significant component of TTS represents P2X2 receptor-dependent purinergic hearing adaptation that underpins the upper physiological range of hearing.},

abstract = {Acoustic overstimulation and ototoxic drugs can cause permanent hearing loss as a result of the damage and death of cochlear hair cells. Relatively little is known about the signaling pathways triggered by such trauma, although a significant role has been described for the c-Jun N-terminal kinase [one of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)] pathway. We investigated the role of another MAPK family, the extracellularly regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) during hair cell damage in neonatal cochlear explants. Within minutes of subjecting explants to mechanical damage, ERK1/2 were transiently activated in Deiters' and phalangeal cells but not in hair cells. The activation of ERK1/2 spread along the length of the cochlea, reaching its peak 5-10 min after damage onset. Release of extracellular ATP and the presence of functional connexin proteins were critical for the activation and spread of ERK1/2. Damage elicited an intercellular Ca(2+) wave in the hair cell region in the first seconds after damage. In the absence of Ca(2+) influx, the intercellular Ca(2+) wave and the magnitude and spread of ERK1/2 activation were reduced. Treatment with the aminoglycoside neomycin produced a similar pattern of ERK1/2 activation in supporting cells surrounding pyknotic hair cells. When ERK1/2 activation was prevented, there was a reduction in the number of pyknotic hair cells. Thus, activation of ERK1/2 in cochlear supporting cells in vitro is a common damage signaling mechanism that acts to promote hair cell death, indicating a direct role for supporting cells in regulating hair cell death.},

The cochlea was exposed by a ventrolateral approach and the bone overlying scala media of the third turn (EL) or scala vestibuli of the first turn (PL) was shaved to a thin layer and a small fenestrum made. For EL sampling, a double-barrelled pipette was inserted through the spiral ligament-stria vascularis complex. One barrel was filled with 150 mM KCl to record the endocochlear potential (EP) and upon the appearance of the positive EP, 0.12-1.22 microliter of fluid was aspirated into the other barrel by gentle negative pressure. For PL sampling, a single-barrelled pipette was advanced into scala vestibuli and 0.3-1.6 microliter of fluid was collected by capillarity. CSF (0.36-1.75 microliter) was obtained from the cisterna magna. The cochleae were removed and processed for light microscopy to determine the extent of tissue damage from the sampling procedure. ATP concentrations (mean +/- SEM, nM) for EL, PL and CSF were 12.95 +/- 2.4 (n = 10), 10.5 +/- 3.9 (n = 11) and 16.1 +/- 5.4 (n = 11) respectively. Differences in ATP concentrations among fluids were not statistically significant. To test the effect of hypoxia on ATP levels, a group of guinea pigs was subjected to a 90 s period of respiratory anoxia prior to sampling of EL, PL or CSF. ATP concentrations were 14.4 +/- 3.5 (n = 11), 20.7 +/- 4.1 (n = 10) and 13.5 +/- 4.6 (n = 4) for EL, PL and CSF, respectively; only PL ATP concentrations were statistically different (P = 0.018, Wilcoxon rank sum test) to basal conditions. This is the first study which demonstrates the presence of free ATP in cochlear fluids. The results indicate that ATP is present in cochlear fluids at concentrations close to those known to cause hair cell depolarization in vitro.},

abstract = {At specific stages of development, nerve and muscle cells generate spontaneous electrical activity that is required for normal maturation of intrinsic excitability and synaptic connectivity. The patterns of this spontaneous activity are not simply immature versions of the mature activity, but rather are highly specialized to initiate and control many aspects of neuronal development. The configuration of voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels that are expressed early in development regulate the timing and waveform of this activity. They also regulate Ca2+ influx during spontaneous activity, which is the first step in triggering activity-dependent developmental programs. For these reasons, the properties of voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels expressed by developing neurons and muscle cells often differ markedly from those of adult cells. When viewed from this perspective, the reasons for complex patterns of ion channel emergence and regression during development become much clearer.},

abstract = {Patterned, spontaneous activity occurs in many developing neural circuits, including the retina, the cochlea, the spinal cord, the cerebellum and the hippocampus, where it provides signals that are important for the development of neurons and their connections. Despite there being differences in adult architecture and output across these various circuits, the patterns of spontaneous network activity and the mechanisms that generate it are remarkably similar. The mechanisms can include a depolarizing action of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), transient synaptic connections, extrasynaptic transmission, gap junction coupling and the presence of pacemaker-like neurons. Interestingly, spontaneous activity is robust; if one element of a circuit is disrupted another will generate similar activity. This research suggests that developing neural circuits exhibit transient and tunable features that maintain a source of correlated activity during crucial stages of development.},

abstract = {Spontaneous electrical activity of neurons in developing sensory systems promotes their maturation and proper connectivity. In the auditory system, spontaneous activity of cochlear inner hair cells (IHCs) is initiated by the release of ATP from glia-like inner supporting cells (ISCs), facilitating maturation of central pathways before hearing onset. Here, we find that ATP stimulates purinergic autoreceptors in ISCs, triggering Cl- efflux and osmotic cell shrinkage by opening TMEM16A Ca2+-activated Cl- channels. Release of Cl- from ISCs also forces K+ efflux, causing transient depolarization of IHCs near ATP release sites. Genetic deletion of TMEM16A markedly reduces the spontaneous activity of IHCs and spiral ganglion neurons in the developing cochlea and prevents ATP-dependent shrinkage of supporting cells. These results indicate that supporting cells in the developing cochlea have adapted a pathway used for fluid secretion in other organs to induce periodic excitation of hair cells.},

The distribution of PEI in the capillary BL in the spiral ligament of the 4- and 7-day-old rats was also significantly greater compared to the adult rats.

To assess hearing sensitivity, at least five mice from each inbred strain had auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds determined. Thus far, we have screened 80 inbred strains of mice; 60 of them exhibited homogeneous ABR threshold values not significantly different from those of the control strain CBA/CaJ. This large database establishes a reliable reference for normal hearing mouse strains. The following 16 inbred strains exhibited significantly elevated ABR thresholds before the age of 3 months: 129/J, 129/ReJ, 129/SvJ, A/J, ALR/LtJ, ALS/LtJ, BUB/BnJ, C57BLKS/J, C57BR/cdJ, C57L/J, DBA/2J, I/LnJ, MA/MyJ, NOD/LtJ, NOR/LtJ, and SKH2/J.

abstract = {Cellular, molecular, and physiological studies have demonstrated an important signaling role for ATP and related nucleotides acting via P2 receptors in the cochlea of the inner ear. Signal modulation is facilitated by ectonucleotidases, a heterologous family of surface-located enzymes involved in extracellular nucleotide hydrolysis. Our previous studies have implicated CD39/NTPDase1 and CD39L1/NTPDase2, members of the ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (E-NTPDase) family, as major ATP-hydrolyzing enzymes in the tissues lining the cochlear endolymphatic and perilymphatic compartments. NTPDase1 hydrolyzes both nucleoside triphosphates and diphosphates. In contrast, NTPDase2 is a preferential nucleoside triphosphatase. This study characterizes expression of these E-NTPDases in the mouse cochlea by immunohistochemistry. NTPDase1 can be immunolocalized to the cochlear vasculature and neural tissues (primary auditory neurons in the spiral ganglion). In contrast, NTPDase2 immunolabeling was principally localized to synaptic regions of the sensory inner and outer hair cells, stereocilia and cuticular plates of the outer hair cells, supporting cells of the organ of Corti (Deiters? cells and inner border cells), efferent nerve fibers located in the intraganglionic spiral bundle, and in the outer sulcus and root region of the spiral ligament. This differential expression of NTPDase1 and 2 in the cochlea suggests spatial regulation of P2 receptor signaling, potentially involving different nucleotide species and hydrolysis kinetics.},

In sensory systems, patterned spontaneous activity before the onset of sensation is thought to influence this process, but this conclusion remains controversial, largely due to the inherent difficulty recording neural activity in early development. Here, we describe genetic and pharmacological manipulations of spontaneous retinal activity, assayed invivo, that demonstrate a causal link between retinal waves and visual circuit refinement. We also report a decoupling of downstream activity in retinorecipient regions of the developing brain after retinal wave disruption. Significantly, we show that the spatiotemporal characteristics of retinal waves affect the development of specific visual circuits. These results conclusively establish retinal waves as necessary and instructive for circuit refinement in the developing nervous system and reveal how neural circuits adjust to altered patterns of activity prior to experience.},

The relative role of these factors and the form of neuronal activity responsible for circuit development is a matter of significant debate. In the mammalian visual system, retinal ganglion cell projections to the brain are mapped with respect to retinotopic location and eye of origin. We manipulated the pattern of spontaneous retinal waves present during development without changing overall activity levels through the transgenic expression of $\beta$2-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in retinal ganglion cells of mice. We used this manipulation to demonstrate that spontaneous retinal activity is not just permissive, but instructive in the emergence of eye-specific segregation and retinotopic refinement in the mouse visual system. This suggests that specific patterns of spontaneous activity throughout the developing brain are essential in the emergence of specific and distinct patterns of neuronal connectivity. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Purines (particularly ATP and adenosine) act as neurotransmitters, gliotransmitters and paracrine factors in the sensory retina, nasal olfactory epithelium, taste buds and cochlea. The associated purinergic receptor signaling underpins the sensory transduction and information coding in these sense organs. The P2 and P1 receptors mediate fast transmission of sensory signals and have modulatory roles in the regulation of synaptic transmitter release, for example in the adaptation to sensory overstimulation. Purinergic signaling regulates bidirectional neuron-glia interactions and is involved in the control of blood supply, extracellular ion homeostasis and the turnover of sensory epithelia by modulating apoptosis and progenitor proliferation. Purinergic signaling is an important player in pathophysiological processes in sensory tissues, and has both detrimental (pro-apoptotic) and supportive (e.g. initiation of cytoprotective stress-signaling cascades) effects. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Summary Neurons in the developing auditory system exhibit spontaneous bursts of activity before hearing onset. How this intrinsically generated activity influences development remains uncertain, because few mechanistic studies have been performed in vivo. We show using macroscopic calcium imaging in unanesthetized mice that neurons responsible for processing similar frequencies of sound exhibit highly synchronized activity throughout the auditory system during this critical phase of development. Spontaneous activity normally requires synaptic excitation of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). Unexpectedly, tonotopic spontaneous activity was preserved in a mouse model of deafness in which glutamate release from hair cells is abolished. SGNs in these mice exhibited enhanced excitability, enabling direct neuronal excitation by supporting cell-induced potassium transients. These results indicate that homeostatic mechanisms maintain spontaneous activity in the pre-hearing period, with significant implications for both circuit development and therapeutic approaches aimed at treating congenital forms of deafness arising through mutations in key sensory transduction components.},

abstract = {Adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) is released as a genuine co-transmitter, or as a principal purinergic neurotransmitter, in an exocytotic and non-exocytotic manner. It activates ionotropic (P2X) and metabotropic (P2Y) receptors which mediate a plethora of functions in the brain. In particular, P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) are expressed in all brain cells and its activation can form a large pore allowing the passage of organic cations, the leakage of metabolites of up to 900 Da and the release of ATP itself. In turn, pannexins (Panx) are a family of proteins forming hemichannels that can release ATP. In this review, we summarize the progress in the understanding of the mechanisms of ATP release both in physiological and pathophysiological stages. We also provide data suggesting that P2X7R and pannexin 1 (Panx1) may form a large pore in cortical neurons as assessed by electrophysiology. Finally, the participation of calcium homeostasis modulator 1 is also suggested, another non-selective ion channel that can release ATP, and that could play a role in ischemic events, together with P2X7 and Panx1 during excitotoxicity by ATP.},

To study gene expression in hair cells, we developed a protocol for hair cell isolation by FACS. With nearly pure hair cells and surrounding cells, from cochlea and utricle and from E16 to P7, we performed a comprehensive cell type-specific RNA-Seq study of gene expression during mouse inner ear development. Expression profiling revealed new hair cell genes with distinct expression patterns: some are specific for vestibular hair cells, others for cochlear hair cells, and some are expressed just before or after maturation of mechanosensitivity. We found that many of the known hereditary deafness genes are much more highly expressed in hair cells than surrounding cells, suggesting that genes preferentially expressed in hair cells are good candidates for unknown deafness genes.},

Our previous studies have determined the presence of ATP in the cochlear fluids and indicated that the purinoceptors are substantially localized to the tissues lining the endolymphatic compartment. This implies that extracellular ATP may have an humoral role confined to the endolymphatic space. In order to study the influence of extracellular ATP in the endolymphatic space, a series of studies were undertaken in which ATP (10 microM to 10 mM) in artificial endolymph (EL) (test solution: 2-12.5 nl) was injected into the scala media and the effect on the cochlear microphonic (CM) and endocochlear potential (EP) evaluated. A double-barrelled pipette, with one barrel containing the test solution and the other artificial EL (control solution) was inserted into scala media of the third turn of the guinea-pig cochlea. A known volume (2-12.5 nl) of test or control solution was then pressure-injected into the space. ATP had a significant dose-dependent suppressive effect on both EP and CM with a threshold of approximately 2 x 10(-14) mol; the response was readily reversible, also in a dose-dependent fashion. Artificial EL of the same volume had no effect on EP and CM. The ATP effect on EP was blocked by the P2 purinoceptor antagonists suramin and reactive blue 2 (RB2). Neither adenosine (2 x 10(-13) to 2 x 10(-11) mol) nor suramin or RB2 on their own had any effect on EP and CM. This study provides the first evidence for an effect of extracellular ATP in the endolymphatic compartment on cochlear function which is mediated via P2 purinoceptors. This provides supporting evidence for an humoral role for extracellular ATP in the modulation of cochlear function.},

However, we still lack in vivo data at this synapse on the maturation of spontaneous and sound-evoked discharge activity before and during the early phase of acoustically evoked signal processing (i.e., before and after hearing onset). Here we report in vivo single-unit recordings in mice from postnatal day 8 (P8) to P28 with a specific focus on developmental changes around hearing onset (P12). Data were obtained from two mouse strains commonly used in brain slice recordings: CBA/J and C57BL/6J. Spontaneous discharge rates progressively increased from P8 to P13, initially showing bursting patterns and large coefficients of variation (CVs), which changed to more continuous and random discharge activity accompanied by gradual decrease of CV around hearing onset. From P12 on, sound-evoked activity yielded phasic-tonic discharge patterns with discharge rates increasing up to P28. Response thresholds and shapes of tuning curves were adult-like by P14. A gradual shortening in response latencies was observed up to P18. The three-dimensional tonotopic organization of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body yielded a high-to-low frequency gradient along the mediolateral and dorsoventral but not in the rostrocaudal axes. These data emphasize that models of signal transmission at the calyx of Held based on in vitro data have to take developmental changes in firing rates and response latencies up to the fourth postnatal week into account.},

abstract = {Purinergic signaling has broad physiological significance to the hearing organ, involving signal transduction via ionotropic P2X receptors and metabotropic G-protein-coupled P2Y and P1 (adenosine), alongside conversion of nucleotides and nucleosides by ecto-nucleotidases and ecto-nucleoside diphosphokinase. In addition, ATP release is modulated by acoustic overstimulation or stress and involves feedback regulation. Many of these principal elements of the purinergic signaling complex have been well characterized in the cochlea, while the characterization of P2Y receptor expression is emerging. The present study used immunohistochemistry to evaluate the expression of five P2Y receptors, P2Y(1), P2Y(2), P2Y(4), P2Y(6), and P2Y(12), during development of the rat cochlea. Commencing in the late embryonic period, the P2Y receptors studied were found in the cells lining the cochlear partition, associated with establishment of the electrochemical environment which provides the driving force for sound transduction. In addition, early postnatal P2Y(2) and P2Y(4) protein expression in the greater epithelial ridge, part of the developing hearing organ, supports the view that initiation and regulation of spontaneous activity in the hair cells prior to hearing onset is mediated by purinergic signaling. Sub-cellular compartmentalization of P2Y receptor expression in sensory hair cells, and diversity of receptor expression in the spiral ganglion neurons and their satellite cells, indicates roles for P2Y receptor-mediated Ca(2+)-signaling in sound transduction and auditory neuron excitability. Overall, the dynamics of P2Y receptor expression during development of the cochlea complement the other elements of the purinergic signaling complex and reinforce the significance of extracellular nucleotide and nucleoside signaling to hearing.},

Genetic and biochemical studies have led to the identification of highly conserved families of guidance molecules, including netrins, Slits, semaphorins, and ephrins. Guidance cues steer axons by regulating cytoskeletal dynamics in the growth cone through signaling pathways that are still only poorly understood. Elaborate regulatory mechanisms ensure that a given cue elicits the right response from the right axons at the right time but is otherwise ignored. With such regulatory mechanisms in place, a relatively small number of guidance factors can be used to generate intricate patterns of neuronal wiring.},

abstract = {This study investigated the characteristics of ecto-nucleotidases in tissues lining the perilymphatic cavity of the cochlea. The perilymphatic space of the isolated guinea-pig cochlea was maintained with oxygenated artificial perilymph (AP) perfused at a rate of 100 $\mu$l/min. Following AP perfusion, either adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or adenosine monophosphate (AMP) was introduced into scala tympani, and perfusion arrested for 2 min for substrate incubation with cochlear tissues. Effluent collected from the cochlea was assayed for adenine nucleotide metabolites by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Extracellular ATP and ADP were rapidly and sequentially hydrolysed to adenosine by Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent and Ca2+/Mg2+-independent enzymatic mechanisms. The degradation of extracellular ATP, ADP and AMP occurred in the presence of intact tissues, as demonstrated by the limited lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity (0–2.2{\%}). ATPase activity was not affected by inhibitors of intracellular ATPases (oligomycin, ouabain, N-ethylmaleimide, 100 $\mu$M NaN3) and non-specific alkaline phosphatase ($\beta$-glycerophosphate). The hydrolysis of ATP was inhibited by 5 mM NaN3, suramin, ATP$\gamma$S, La3+ and CTP, the hydrolysis of ADP by $\beta$,$\gamma$-imidoATP, and AMP degradation by $\alpha$,$\beta$-methyleneADP. Ecto-ATPase, ecto-ADPase and ecto-5′-nucleotidase followed Michaelis-Menten hyperbolic kinetics, with estimated Km values of 2282 $\mu$M, 6619 $\mu$M and 881 $\mu$M, respectively. Our results indicate the presence of considerable ecto-nucleotidase activity within scala tympani of the cochlea, and support its role as the terminating mechanism for P2 receptor signalling known to occur in the cochlea. A competition plot is consistent with ATP and ADP degradation mediated by the same enzyme (ecto-ADP diphosphohydrolase) with two different catalytic sites.},

abstract = {SignificancePainfully loud sound causes protective or withdrawal responses, rather than continued listening. This differential behavior invites comparison with somatic pain responses driven by the anatomically distinct subset of small-diameter, unmyelinated afferents--C fibers. Like somatic C fibers, unmyelinated type II cochlear afferents differ in size, number, and innervation pattern from type I afferents that encode sound. Here, we show that type II afferents are excited during cochlear tissue damage in part by the algogenic cytoplasmic metabolite adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This finding, together with previous evidence that type II afferents respond weakly to synaptic transmission from cochlear hair cells, and normally are insensitive to sound, supports the identification of type II afferents as cochlear nociceptors, mediating the sensation of painfully loud sound. In the mammalian cochlea, acoustic information is carried to the brain by the predominant (95{\%}) large-diameter, myelinated type I afferents, each of which is postsynaptic to a single inner hair cell. The remaining thin, unmyelinated type II afferents extend hundreds of microns along the cochlear duct to contact many outer hair cells. Despite this extensive arbor, type II afferents are weakly activated by outer hair cell transmitter release and are insensitive to sound. Intriguingly, type II afferents remain intact in damaged regions of the cochlea. Here, we show that type II afferents are activated when outer hair cells are damaged. This response depends on both ionotropic (P2X) and metabotropic (P2Y) purinergic receptors, binding ATP released from nearby supporting cells in response to hair cell damage. Selective activation of P2Y receptors increased type II afferent excitability by the closure of KCNQ-type potassium channels, a potential mechanism for the painful hypersensitivity (that we term "noxacusis" to distinguish from hyperacusis without pain) that can accompany hearing loss. Exposure to the KCNQ channel activator retigabine suppressed the type II fiber's response to hair cell damage. Type II afferents may be the cochlea's nociceptors, prompting avoidance of further damage to the irreparable inner ear.},

abstract = {Rapid changes in extracellular K+ concentration ([K +]o) in the mammalian CNS are counteracted by simple passive diffusion as well as by cellular mechanisms of K+ clearance. Buffering of [K+]o can occur via glial or neuronal uptake of K+ ions through transporters or K+-selective channels. The best studied mechanism for [K+]o buffering in the brain is called K+ spatial buffering, wherein the glial syncytium disperses local extracellular K+ increases by transferring K + ions from sites of elevated [K+]o to those with lower [K+]o. In recent years, K+ spatial buffering has been implicated or directly demonstrated by a variety of experimental approaches including electrophysiological and optical methods. A specialized form of spatial buffering named K+ siphoning takes place in the vertebrate retina, where glial M{\"{u}}ller cells express inwardly rectifying K+ channels (Kir channels) positioned in the membrane domains near to the vitreous humor and blood vessels. This highly compartmentalized distribution of Kir channels in retinal glia directs K + ions from the synaptic layers to the vitreous humor and blood vessels. Here, we review the principal mechanisms of [K+]o buffering in the CNS and recent molecular studies on the structure and functions of glial Kir channels. We also discuss intriguing new data that suggest a close physical and functional relationship between Kir and water channels in glial cells. {\textcopyright} 2004 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Key points In the synaptic cleft between type I hair cells and calyceal afferents, K+ ions accumulate as a function of activity, dynamically altering the driving force and permeation through ion channels facing the synaptic cleft. High-fidelity synaptic transmission is possible due to large conductances that minimize hair cell and afferent time constants in the presence of significant membrane capacitance. Elevated potassium maintains hair cells near a potential where transduction currents are sufficient to depolarize them to voltages necessary for calcium influx and synaptic vesicle fusion. Elevated potassium depolarizes the postsynaptic afferent by altering ion permeation through hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, and contributes to depolarizing the afferent to potentials where a single EPSP (quantum) can generate an action potential. With increased stimulation, hair cell depolarization increases the frequency of quanta released, elevates [K+]cleft and depolarizes the afferent to potentials at which smaller and smaller EPSPs would be sufficient to trigger APs. Abstract Fast neurotransmitters act in conjunction with slower modulatory effectors that accumulate in restricted synaptic spaces found at giant synapses such as the calyceal endings in the auditory and vestibular systems. Here, we used dual patch-clamp recordings from turtle vestibular hair cells and their afferent neurons to show that potassium ions accumulating in the synaptic cleft modulated membrane potentials and extended the range of information transfer. High-fidelity synaptic transmission was possible due to large conductances that minimized hair cell and afferent time constants in the presence of significant membrane capacitance. Increased potassium concentration in the cleft maintained the hair cell near potentials that promoted the influx of calcium necessary for synaptic vesicle fusion. The elevated potassium concentration also depolarized the postsynaptic neuron by altering ion permeation through hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels. This depolarization enabled the afferent to reliably generate action potentials evoked by single AMPA-dependent EPSPs. Depolarization of the postsynaptic afferent could also elevate potassium in the synaptic cleft, and would depolarize other hair cells enveloped by the same neuritic process increasing the fidelity of neurotransmission at those synapses as well. Collectively, these data demonstrate that neuronal activity gives rise to potassium accumulation, and suggest that potassium ion action on HCN channels can modulate neurotransmission, preserving the fidelity of high-speed synaptic transmission by dynamically shifting the resting potentials of both presynaptic and postsynaptic cells.},

abstract = {The developing cochlea of mammals contains a large group of columnar-shaped cells, which together form a structure known as K{\"{o}}lliker's organ. Prior to the onset of hearing, these inner supporting cells periodically release adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), which activates purinergic receptors in surrounding supporting cells, inner hair cells and the dendrites of primary auditory neurons. Recent studies indicate that purinergic signaling between inner supporting cells and inner hair cells initiates bursts of action potentials in auditory nerve fibers before the onset of hearing. ATP also induces prominent effects in inner supporting cells, including an increase in membrane conductance, a rise in intracellular Ca(2+), and dramatic changes in cell shape, although the importance of ATP signaling in non-sensory cells of the developing cochlea remains unknown. Here, we review current knowledge pertaining to purinergic signaling in supporting cells of K{\"{o}}lliker's organ and focus on the mechanisms by which ATP induces changes in their morphology. We show that these changes in cell shape are preceded by increases in cytoplasmic Ca(2+), and provide new evidence indicating that elevation of intracellular Ca(2+) and IP(3) are sufficient to initiate shape changes. In addition, we discuss the possibility that these ATP-mediated morphological changes reflect crenation following the activation of Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channels, and speculate about the possible functions of these changes in cell morphology for maturation of the cochlea.},

abstract = {The maturation of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon projections in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and the superior colliculus (SC) relies on both molecular and activity-dependent mechanisms. Despite the increasing popularity of the mouse as a mammalian visual system model, little is known in this species about the normal development of individual RGC axon arbors or the role of activity in this process. We used a novel in vivo single RGC labeling technique to quantitatively characterize the elaboration and refinement of RGC axon arbors in the dLGN and SC in wild-type (WT) and $\beta$2-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors mutant ($\beta$2 -/- ) mice, which have perturbed retinal waves, during the developmental period when eye-specific lamination and retinotopic refinement occurs. Our results suggest that eye-specific segregation and retinotopic refinement in WT mice are not the result of refinement of richly exuberant arbors but rather the elaboration of arbors prepositioned in the proper location combined with the elimination of inappropriately targeted sparse branches. We found that retinocollicular arbors mature ∼1 week earlier than retinogeniculate arbors, although RGC axons reach the dLGN and SC at roughly the same age. We also observed striking differences between contralateral and ipsilateral RGC axon arbors in the SC but not in the LGN. These data suggest a strong influence of target specific cues during arbor maturation. In $\beta$2 -/- mice, we found that retinofugal single axon arbors are well ramified but enlarged, particularly in the SC, indicating that activity-dependent visual map development occurs through the refinement of individual RGC arbors.

abstract = {Both Ca2+ and H+ play a role in chemical gating of gap junction channels, but, with the possible exception of Cx46 hemichannels, neither of them is likely to induce gating by a direct interaction with connexins. Some evidence suggests that low pHi affects gating via an increase in [Ca2+]i; in turn, Ca2+ is likely to induce gating by activation of CaM, which may act directly as a gating particle. The effective concentrations of both Ca2+ and H + vary depending on cell type, type of connexin expressed and procedure employed to increase their cytosolic concentrations; however, pH i as high as 7.2 and [Ca2+]i as low as 150 nM or lower have been reported to be effective in some cells. Some data suggest that Ca2+ and H+ affect gating by acting synergistically, but other data do not support synergism. Chemical gating follows the activation of a slow gate distinct from the fast Vj-sensitive gate, and there is evidence that the chemical/slow gate is Vj-sensitive. At the single channel level, the chemical/slow gate closes the channels slowly and completely, whereas the fast Vj gate closes the channels rapidly and incompletely. At least three molecular models of channel gating have been proposed, but all of them are mostly based on circumstantial evidence. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In the auditory system, patterned firing activity has been observed in immature spiral ganglion and brain-stem neurons and is likely to depend on cochlear inner hair cell (IHC) action potentials. It remains uncertain whether spiking activity is intrinsic to developing IHCs and whether it shows patterning. We found that action potentials were intrinsically generated by immature IHCs of altricial rodents and that apical IHCs showed bursting activity as opposed to more sustained firing in basal cells. We show that the efferent neurotransmitter acetylcholine fine-tunes the IHC's resting membrane potential (V(m)), and as such is crucial for the bursting pattern in apical cells. Endogenous extracellular ATP also contributes to the V(m) of apical and basal IHCs by triggering small-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (SK2) channels. We propose that the difference in firing pattern along the cochlea instructs the tonotopic differentiation of IHCs and auditory pathway.},

abstract = {The mode of synaptic transmission in the vestibular periphery, between type I hair cells and their associated calyx terminal, has been the subject of much debate. The close and extensive apposition of pre- and post-synaptic elements has led some to suggest potassium (K+) accumulates in the intercellular space and even plays a role in synaptic transmission. During patch clamp recordings from isolated and embedded hair cells in a semi-intact preparation of the mouse cristae, we noted marked differences in whole-cell currents. Embedded type I hair cells show a prominent droop during steady-state activation as well as a dramatic collapse in tail currents. Responses to a depolarizing voltage step (−124 to +16 mV) in embedded, but not isolated, hair cells resulted in a {\textgreater}40 mV shift of the K+ equilibrium potential and a rise in effective K+ concentration ({\textgreater}50 mM) in the intercellular space. Together these data suggest K+ accumulation in the intercellular space accounts for the different responses in isolated and embedded type I hair cells. To test this notion, we exposed the preparation to hyperosmotic solutions to enlarge the intercellular space. As predicted, the K+ accumulation effects were reduced; however, a fit of our data with a classic diffusion model suggested K+ permeability, rather than the intercellular space, had been altered by the hyperosmotic change. These results support the notion that under depolarizing conditions substantial K+ accumulation occurs in the space between type I hair cells and calyx. The extent of K+ accumulation during normal synaptic transmission, however, remains to be determined.},

The 15 members of the K2P channels are identified and classified into six subfamilies on the basis of their sequence similarities. The activity of the channels is dynamically regulated by various physical, chemical, and biological effectors. The channels are expressed in a wide variety of tissues in mammals in an isoform specific manner, and play various roles in many physiological and pathophysiological conditions. To function as channels, the K2P channels form dimers, and some isoforms form heterodimers that provide diversity in channel properties. In the brain, TWIK1, TREK1, TREK2, TRAAK, TASK1, and TASK3 are predominantly expressed in various regions, including the cerebral cortex, dentate gyrus, CA1-CA3, and granular layer of the cerebellum. TWIK1, TREK1, and TASK1 are highly expressed in astrocytes, where they play specific cellular roles. Astrocytes keep leak K(+) conductance, called the passive conductance, which mainly involves TWIK1-TREK1 heterodimeric channel. TWIK1 and TREK1 also mediate glutamate release from astrocytes in an exocytosis-independent manner. The expression of TREK1 and TREK2 in astrocytes increases under ischemic conditions, that enhance neuroprotection from ischemia. Accumulated evidence has indicated that astrocytes, together with neurons, are involved in brain function, with the K2P channels playing critical role in these astrocytes.},

However, the mechanisms responsible for initiating auditory nerve firing in the absence of sound have not been determined. Here we show that supporting cells in the developing rat cochlea spontaneously release ATP, which causes nearby inner hair cells to depolarize and release glutamate, triggering discrete bursts of action potentials in primary auditory neurons. This endogenous, ATP-mediated signalling synchronizes the output of neighbouring inner hair cells, which may help refine tonotopic maps in the brain. Spontaneous ATP-dependent signalling rapidly subsides after the onset of hearing, thereby preventing this experience-independent activity from interfering with accurate encoding of sound. These data indicate that supporting cells in the organ of Corti initiate electrical activity in auditory nerves before hearing, pointing to an essential role for peripheral, non-sensory cells in the development of central auditory pathways.},

abstract = {Purinoreceptors of the P2 family contribute strongly to signaling in the cochlea, but little is known about the effects of purinergic neurotransmission in the central auditory system. Here we examine P2 receptor-mediated signaling in the large spherical bushy cells (SBCs) of Mongolian gerbils around the onset of acoustically evoked signal processing (P9 -P14). Brief adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATP$\gamma$S) application evoked inward current, membrane depolarization, and somatic Ca2+ signals. Moreover, ATP$\gamma$S changed the SBCs firing pattern from phasic to tonic, when the application was synchronized with depolarizing current injection. This bursting discharge activity was dependent on [Ca2+]i and Ca 2+-dependent protein kinase (PKC) activity and is presumably caused by modulation of low-threshold K+ conductance. Activation of P2Y 1 receptors could not evoke these changes per se, thus it was concluded that the involvement of P2X receptors seems to be necessary. Ca 2+ imaging data showed that both P2X and P2Y1 receptors mediate Ca2+ signals in SBCs where P2Y1 receptors most likely activate the PLC-IP3 (inositol trisphosphate) pathway and release Ca2+ from internal stores. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the expression of P2X2 and P2Y1 receptor proteins in SBCs, providing additional evidence for the involvement of both receptors in signal transduction in these neurons. Purinergic signaling might modulate excitability of SBCs and thereby contribute to regulation of synaptic strength. Functionally, the increase in firing rate mediated by P2 receptors could reduce temporal precision of the postsynaptic firing, e.g., phase locking, which has an immediate effect on signal processing related to sound localization. This might provide a mechanism for adaptation to the ambient acoustic environment. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2009 The American Physiological Society.},

abstract = {Spontaneous electrical activity is a common feature of sensory systems during early development. This sensory-independent neuronal activity has been implicated in promoting their survival and maturation, as well as growth and refinement of their projections to yield circuits that can rapidly extract information about the external world. Periodic bursts of action potentials occur in auditory neurons of mammals before hearing onset. This activity is induced by inner hair cells (IHCs) within the developing cochlea, which establish functional connections with spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) several weeks before they are capable of detecting external sounds. During this pre-hearing period, IHCs fire periodic bursts of Ca(2+) action potentials that excite SGNs, triggering brief but intense periods of activity that pass through auditory centers of the brain. Although spontaneous activity requires input from IHCs, there is ongoing debate about whether IHCs are intrinsically active and their firing periodically interrupted by external inhibitory input (IHC-inhibition model), or are intrinsically silent and their firing periodically promoted by an external excitatory stimulus (IHC-excitation model). There is accumulating evidence that inner supporting cells in K{\"{o}}lliker's organ spontaneously release ATP during this time, which can induce bursts of Ca(2+) spikes in IHCs that recapitulate many features of auditory neuron activity observed in vivo. Nevertheless, the role of supporting cells in this process remains to be established in vivo. A greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for generating IHC activity in the developing cochlea will help reveal how these events contribute to the maturation of nascent auditory circuits.},

abstract = {Membrane-bound P2-receptors mediate the actions of extracellular nucleotides in cell-to-cell signalling. P2X-receptors are ligand-gated ion channels, whereas P2Y-receptors belong to the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). So far, the P2Y family is composed out of 8 human subtypes that have been cloned and functionally defined; species orthologues have been found in many vertebrates. P2Y1-, P2Y2-, P2Y4-, P2Y6-, and P2Y11-receptors all couple to stimulation of phospholipase C. The P2Y11-receptor mediates in addition a stimulation of adenylate cyclase. In contrast, activation of the P2Y12-, P2Y13-, and P2Y14-receptors causes an inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity. The expression of P2Y1-receptors is widespread. The receptor is involved in blood platelet aggregation, vasodilatation and neuromodulation. It is activated by ADP and ADP analogues including 2-methylthio-ADP (2-MeSADP). 2′-Deoxy-N6-methyladenosine-3′,5′-bisphosphate (MRS2179) and 2-chloro-N6-methyl-(N)-methanocarba-2′-deoxyadenosine 3′,5′-bisphosphate (MRS2279) are potent and selective antagonists. P2Y2 transcripts are abundantly distributed. One important example for its functional role is the control of chloride ion fluxes in airway epithelia. The P2Y2-receptor is activated by UTP and ATP and blocked by suramin. The P2Y2-agonist diquafosol is used for the treatment of the dry eye disease. P2Y4-receptors are expressed in the placenta and in epithelia. The human P2Y4-receptor has a strong preference for UTP as agonist, whereas the rat P2Y4-receptor is activated about equally by UTP and ATP. The P2Y4-receptor is not blocked by suramin. The P2Y6-receptor has a widespread distribution including heart, blood vessels, and brain. The receptor prefers UDP as agonist and is selectively blocked by 1,2-di-(4-isothiocyanatophenyl)ethane (MRS2567). The P2Y11-receptor may play a role in the differentiation of immunocytes. The human P2Y11-receptor is activated by ATP as naturally occurring agonist and it is blocked by suramin and reactive blue 2 (RB2). The P2Y12-receptor plays a crucial role in platelet aggregation as well as in inhibition of neuronal cells. It is activated by ADP and very potently by 2-methylthio-ADP. Nucleotide antagonists including N6-(2-methylthioethyl)-2-(3,3,3-trifluoropropylthio)-$\beta$,$\gamma$-dichloromethylene-ATP (=cangrelor; AR-C69931MX), the nucleoside analogue AZD6140, as well as active metabolites of the thienopyridine compounds clopidogrel and prasugrel block the receptor. These P2Y12-antagonists are used in pharmacotherapy to inhibit platelet aggregation. The P2Y13-receptor is expressed in immunocytes and neuronal cells and is again activated by ADP and 2-methylthio-ADP. The 2-chloro-5-nitro pyridoxal-phosphate analogue 6-(2′-chloro-5′-nitro-azophenyl)-pyridoxal-$\alpha$5-phosphate (MRS2211) is a selective antagonist. mRNA encoding for the human P2Y14-receptor is found in many tissues. However, a physiological role of the receptor has not yet been established. UDP-glucose and related analogues act as agonists; antagonists are not known. Finally, UDP has been reported to act on receptors for cysteinyl leukotrienes as an additional agonist—indicating a dual agonist specificity of these receptors.},
